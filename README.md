تصميم ذراع روبوت خدمة العملاء مع مراعاة تصميم امامكن للمحركات والرمان بلي او البيرينغ 
In a file ( customer service robot hand 0) containing the final shape after assembling the arm, as well as linking it with the shoulder
I also downloaded all the parts in separate files and did not assemble the arm with the file (shoulder part2) because the piece may not fit the arm as the image of the motor was not complete in my mind, but the idea was to put a place for the motor and then in the file (shoulder part 2) and connect it to the head and then connect to the bearing Then reach the arm

In the previous picture, I designed the shoulder in a simplified way, and I do not know if the design is suitable with the movement of the arm or not

I designed the upper arm section, also called a file (customer service robot hand p2) so that I tried to open a place for the motor wires to pass inside the arm and not spoil the aesthetic view of the design
